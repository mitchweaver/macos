# Mouse Acceleration

Mouse Acceleration sucks. Why it's the default on every operating system
is beyond me. Ruins any hope of development of muscle memory when using
a mouse with a computer.

And Apple, being as obtuse and defiant as always, does not have a
built-in easy way of disabling it. *Because they know best!*

Best app that I've found that works with no fuss is LinearMouse.

Just put "Linear Movement: On" and add it to your login items.
